    <h1>Template for killer Website Content</h1>

   <p> Over the years of developing websites for cilents,I've learned that the age-old adage,
    <span>"If you want it done right,you gotta do it yourself,"</span> can be a two-way street.</p>


    <p>in cases where we give in and let the cilent take the content reins,we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a flighting chance to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use,and an explanantion of what's included.</p>

    <h3>Website content template components</h3>

    <p>Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page,you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted.<br/><br/> What,s their pain?<br/> What,s in it for them? <br/>Where are they in their buying process? <br/>And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your solution? <br/> <br/>The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer's shoes and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyers.</p>
