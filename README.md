HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

Purpose:

HTML is used to structure the content on the web, defining the layout and organization of a webpage.

Key Features:

Elements and Tags: HTML uses elements encapsulated in tags to represent different parts of a webpage. For example, <p> for paragraphs, <h1> to <h6> for headings, <a> for hyperlinks, <div> for divisions or sections, and <img> for images.
Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information. For instance, the href attribute in <a> defines the link destination, and the src attribute in <img> specifies the image source.
Forms: HTML provides form elements like <form>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button> to collect user input.
Semantic HTML: Using tags like <article>, <section>, <header>, and <footer> to give meaning to the web content and improve accessibility and SEO.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Purpose:

CSS is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of HTML elements. It enhances the appearance and user experience of web pages.

Key Features:

Selectors: CSS selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. Common selectors include element selectors (e.g., p), class selectors (e.g., .classname), ID selectors (e.g., #idname), and attribute selectors.
Properties and Values: CSS uses properties (e.g., color, font-size, margin, padding, background) and their values to define styles. For example, color: red; sets the text color to red.
Box Model: CSS uses the box model to represent the layout of elements. The box model consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content area.
Responsive Design: CSS enables responsive design through media queries, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Flexbox and Grid: CSS provides layout models like Flexbox and Grid for creating complex, responsive layouts.
